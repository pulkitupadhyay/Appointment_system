Appointment system configuration file 

for testing pourpuse we have to make changes in the following files :: 



setup a local mongodb server in your system ***** most important 



1. .env file 

if there is no .env file you will have to make one env file and input certain parameters in that 

MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://pulkit_ji:EkJTiZhfUWss7Qk1@cluster0.xbds8cy.mongodb.net/appointment_systems_database?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
ACCESSKEYID="AKIAZYANV5AOAYFJQN66"
SECRETACCESSKEY="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"
BUCKETNAME="swaayattappointmentsystem"
BUCKETREGION="us-west-1"
NAME="pulkit"


now you have to change********(only comment out the current mongo uri because it is only for deployment ))********* the mongo_uri to your local mongodb clustur instance which is running on you local system on port 27017

2. routes/other_functions/send_mail 

    there is the options parameter in the senmail function ***to*** 
	if you are deployign comment out the code for testing and if you are testing comment out the code for testing. 

3  routes/other_functions/send_mail_cc 

	same as  routes/other_functions/send_mail 


now you are good to go with the run command * npx nodemon *
